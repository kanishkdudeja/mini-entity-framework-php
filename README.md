# Introduction

This is a minimal Entity Framework that you can use in your PHP project.

You can use it to:

* Model various real-world entities as objects in your code.
* Manage database (MySQL) interaction for entities in your project. 
* Serve REST APIs.

# Work In Progress

Documentation for using the framework will be added shortly.

Till then, please check src/User.php and src/API.php for examples on how you can use the framework.
